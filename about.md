Hi, I'm Simon. I'm a student at Vienna's University of Technology, studying Electrical Engineering with a focus on telecommunications.

I'm very interested in everything and anything that combines the sciences with the arts and humanities, as well as skillful and high-quality realizations of either of them. If you happen to be in Vienna and would like to meet up for a cup of coffee and an exchange of ideas, feel free to drop me a line: simon.hellmayr@gmail.com.
